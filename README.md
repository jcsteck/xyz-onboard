# aframe-school

Interactive workshop and lessons for learning [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and
WebVR. Based around [Glitch](https://glitch.com).

Can either be self-led or be used as part of a hands-on event (e.g., tutorial
or workshop). If you are holding an event, you can present the [A-Frame
Presentation Kit](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-presentation-kit) as a
primer beforehand.

## Grabbing the School

If you're having trouble accessing the School online and need to download the
School locally (e.g., the Internet connection at your event is poor):

1. [Download the School (.ZIP)](http://github.com/aframevr/aframe-school/zipball/master)
2. Start a local web server in the same directory as the School (e.g., run
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in a terminal). Alternatively, run the provided
`mongoose.exe` on Windows or `mongoose.app` on MacOS.

## Working on the School

The School is built using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
All of the pages of the School are maintained in a single markdown file,
`content.md`. Use `------` to separate sections and `---` to separate
subsections.
